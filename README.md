## how to make a readme file

This is a "markdown" file. You can edit it in vscode.

The syntax of markdown is similar to how you would do comment formatting on reddit (theirs is a subset).

In vscode all you have to do once you've got this file open (and if you've installed the right extensions) hit F1 and look for "Markdown: Open Locked Preview to the Side" and click that.

This tells about all the official syntax: https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/
